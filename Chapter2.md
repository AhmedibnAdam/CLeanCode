Names are everywhere in software. <br\>
We name our variables, our functions, our arguments, classes, and packages.  <br\>
We name our source files and the directories that contain them.  <br\>
We name our jar files and war files and ear files.  <br\>
We name and name and name.  <br\>
Because we do so much of it, weâ€™d better do it well.  <br\>
What follows are some simple rules for creating good names.  <br\>
