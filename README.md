I used this summary of some key points that I made to study the book Clean Code.<br/>
I hope it helps others.<br/>
(Note: this summary doesn't exclude the need to read the book.)<br/>
<br/><br/>
first of all , I would like to highlight a few quotes 
<br/>

## Why bad code ?! <br/>
# What makes me write a bad code ?! <br/>

 * your boss does not give you time 
 * you want to finish faster to get more backlog's stories finished
 * don't have experince 
 * I will clean it later 
 
# be carful 

“Later equals never.” <br/>
Bad code can bring a company down. <br/>
“The only way to make the deadline — the only way to go fast — is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.”

## What Is Clean Code?

* The code can be measured with either "good" or "bad" in the code review or by how many minutes it takes you to talk about it.

* A clean code should be elegant, efficient, readable, simple, without duplications, and well-written. 

* You should add value to the business with your code.

* Clean code offers quality and understanding when we open a class.

* It is necessary that your code is clean and readable for anyone to find and easily understand. Avoid wasting others' time.
 


## How could i write clean code ?!
 there are rules aand tips you can take it in consideration while coding 
 
# General rules

* Follow standard conventions.
* Keep it simple stupid  ( KISS ) <br/>
   Simpler is always better.<br/>
   Reduce complexity as much as possible.
* Boy scout rule " Leave the campground cleaner than you found it."
* Always find root cause. <br/>
  Always look for the root cause of a problem.
  
  # Understandability tips
* Be consistent. <br/>
  If you do something a certain way, do all similar things in the same way.
* Use explanatory variables.
* Encapsulate boundary conditions. <br/>
  Boundary conditions are hard to keep track of. Put the processing for them in one place.
* Prefer dedicated value objects to primitive type. 
* Avoid logical dependency. <br/>
  Don't write methods which works correctly depending on something else in the same class.
* Avoid negative conditionals. <br/>

# so what is exactly the code could I called it's clean 
in my opinon you could called the code clean when it is 
* Readable 
* Crips and clear
* Be consistent
* Maintainable 
* Scalable 
* Testable 
* Meaningful names
* No duplicates
* Less dependancy
* code quality

# when should we clean ?!
All the time 

# final ,
“Practice, son. Practice!”
